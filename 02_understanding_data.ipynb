    "Imagine you work for a company called NV-WholeSale, a wholesale food products distribution company, with hundreds of locations spread across the United States. NV-WholeSale offers low warehouse prices for quality products, as a result most restaurants in the vicinity purchase groceries, raw materials, disposable kitchenware, and other essentials in bulk from NV-WholeSale through online orders. The company has established Distribution Centers (DCs) in most cities, and raw materials are transported daily from these DCs to restaurants, commercial clients, and healthcare facilities.\n",

    "We use cuDF, the GPU equivalent of pandas, for data analysis [RAPIDS cuDF](https://rapids.ai/). cuDF is a Python GPU DataFrame library (built on the Apache Arrow columnar memory format) for loading, joining, aggregating, filtering, and otherwise manipulating data. cuDF also provides a pandas-like API that will be familiar to data engineers & data scientists, so you can use it to easily accelerate their workflows without going into the details of CUDA programming. cuDF accelerates workflows where the data is large by leveraging the GPU(s). To understand why cuDF performs well with GPUs, feel to refer to this [blog!](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/pandas-dataframe-tutorial-beginners-guide-to-gpu-accelerated-dataframes-in-python/)"
